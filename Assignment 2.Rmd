## Developing Data Products Assignment 1

### Instructions:
* 1. Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

* 2. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

* 3. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

### Load the packages 
```{r setup, echo=TRUE}
library(shiny)
library(leaflet)
```

## Creating the map

```{r, echo=TRUE}
map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng=-35.255127, lat=-5.812757, popup="Natal City")
leaflet(map, options = leafletOptions(minZoom = 0, maxZoom = 18))

map
```
